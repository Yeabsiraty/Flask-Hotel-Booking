1.cerate all tables which found on mysql hotel.txt on your mysql workbeanch.


      --- edit this codes ---

2. on the first main.py file and on the second file which found on the hotel admin edit this code
      app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "thisissecret@34256^&"
      app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = '' #your host mostly it is 'localhost'
      app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = '' # your database username
      app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = '' # your database password
      app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'My_Hotel'

3. on the first main.py change this code to make the email sending process work the hotel admin have no email sending process
      passw = "" # use your email password
      from_user = ""  # use your email on this 

4. to login in admin dashboard first you need to edit main.py found inside hotel admin
      1) on line 37 edit the status_check code delete 'not' or replace the status_check method with this code until you logeed in and              create an admin:
                        def status_check(f):
                            @wraps(f)
                            def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
                                if  1 != 1 : 
                                    return redirect(url_for("login")) 
                                return f(*args, **kwargs)
                            return decorated_function
      2) after you change the status_check code now simplly add this url on the browser next to the page url like this
            - add dashboard next to the url like this
                  - http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard
                  - and now you redirect to the dashboard so got to the staff and add employee and dont forget his or her Employee_Id                         first name and last name.
                  - goto admin and click on add button and add new admin dont forget the Employee_Id,First_Name and Last_Name must be the                     same with the staff table data 
                  - after you add the admin dont forget to change the status_check method with this code which found on line 37 
                        def status_check(f):
                            @wraps(f)
                            def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
                                if "status" not in session or session["status"] == False:
                                    return redirect(url_for("login")) 
                                return f(*args, **kwargs)
                            return decorated_function
